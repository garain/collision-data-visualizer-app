# Collision Data Visualizer Tool 
This is a collision data visualizer tool for visualizing vehicle collision data in New York City.

# Notes
It's great if the app opens instantly.
However the app may take approx 10 to 15 minutes to load for the first time you open the app. Thereafter whenever you go to the link it runs smoothly and very fast, as the data files get cached in the browser. There is option to clear the cache. The visualization is for 10999 rows of data.

# Raw data
To view your data select "Show Raw data" option.
